This is open AI gym based baghchal project. 

Currently it is still under progress, the environment for baghchal in open AI gym is yet to be ready. 

For environment code: go through gym_baghchal -> envs -> baghchal_env.py

For Q-learning implementation with environment: gym-Q_learning -> baghchal_Q_learning.ipynb

TO DO:

1. There are minor errors to handle in the environment code. You can go through gym-Q_learning -> baghchal_Q_learning.ipynb and check the errors in step function (in cell 3). The output in cell 20 can help to debug the code. the cell 20 can run infinitely, better to stop it as it reaches more than 2 minutes.

2. After the environment is ready,  Baghchal_RL/gym-Q_learning/custom_baghchal.ipynb, we can integrate the environment with Q-learing algorithm here.


Feel free to contribute to this project if you are interested.
